Recommended Report Outline: Team Experience Analysis
(include all team member names listed alphabetically by last name and section #)
Purpose of This Template
This outline is provided to help you structure a professional, management-ready analytics report. Using this structure is recommended (but not required). Reports that follow a clear structure tend to communicate insights more effectively and may be easier for the AI grader to evaluate accurately.
1. Executive Summary
Provide a concise summary of the purpose of the analysis, the most important findings, and the key implications or recommendations. A manager should be able to understand the main story by reading only this section.
2. Analytical Questions & Context
Clearly state the main business or analytical questions your team chose to explore. Briefly explain why these questions matter for understanding team experiences or improving future team design.
3. Data Overview & Analytical Approach
Briefly describe what the dataset represents and how you approached the analysis. Focus on analytical intent rather than technical details.
4. Key Findings (Evidence)
Present your most important findings using well-labeled tables and charts. Each visual should support a specific point and be referenced in the accompanying text.
5. Interpretation & Reasoning
Explain what the findings suggest. Clearly connect data evidence to conclusions or inferences. Appropriately qualify claims based on the data available.
6. Recommendations & Decision Implications
Based on the analysis, provide evidence-based recommendations or decision opportunities. Explain how each recommendation follows from the data.
7. Limitations & Reflection (Optional)
Briefly acknowledge limitations of the data or analysis and identify questions that could be explored with additional data.
8. Appendix (Optional)
Include additional tables or charts that support the analysis but are not central to the main narrative.
